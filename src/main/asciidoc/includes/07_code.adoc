== Code
Although other sections of the documentation describe the overall architecture of the software, often you'll want to present lower level details to explain how things work.
This is what the code section is for.
Some software architecture documentation templates call this the "implementation view" or the "development view".


This is some sequence diagrams:

[plantuml, sequence_diagram_test, png]
....
include::07_code/sequence_diagram_test.puml[]
....

---

[plantuml, big_sequence_diagram, png]
....
include::07_code/big_sequence_diagram.puml[]
....

NOTE: The following example shows the difference between asynchronous call and synchronous call.

[plantuml, synch_call_vs_asynch_call, png]
....
A->B: synchronous call
A->>B: asynchronous call
....
